# So, What is This?
This repository contains all code examples for the demos from my [Pluralsight](https://www.Pluralsight.com "Pluralsight") course: Styling Angular Applications. Use these files to follow along with the course or for whatever you want really.

#Styling Angular Applications
Angular revolutionizes the way that we architect CSS for modern web applications. But before we can become Angular styling ninjas we need to take a step back consider the many different ways that things can be done. In this course we explore how the framework aligns with web components and what that means for adding styles to components and apps in general. Throughout this course we develop systems geared towards organization, scale, and maintainability for HTML and CSS within Angular apps. And as we get more comfortable adding and styling components within these systems we consider component themes and the ways that we can transform their look under certain circumstances. By the end of this course we'll have a strong knowledge of how Angular processes CSS and the many different ways it can be leveraged as part of an overall design system for creating beautiful, organized, maintainable, and future proof web applications.

2. Clone the repository down to your computer
`https://github.com/pluralsight-styling-angular-apps/demos.git`
3. CD to the project folder
`cd demos`
4. Install project dependencies
`npm install`
5. Build the code, watch for file changes, and serve up the site locally
`npm start`

### Working With the Demos
This repository contains the entire set of 56 demos for the course. To switch between demos you'll just need to checkout the proper branch. In order to know what branch to use for a given demo, the branch name is briefly displayed in the lower right hand corner of the video clip every time a code example is shown. The branches are named by module, for example, the first demo in module 02 is named `module-02-01` whereas the sixth demo in module 04 is named `module-04-06`.

#### Module 02
`module-02-01` - `module-02-16`

#### Module 03
`module-03-01` - `module-03-25`

#### Module 04
`module-04-01` - `module-04-15`
